# 31-2-smart-pointer-implementation

Implement a smart pointer shared_ptr_toy with distributed access and reference counting mechanics for the Toy class implemented in the task.

The pointer should:
have all standard class methods,
be a functional replacement for using shared_ptr<Toy>

Implement the free function make_shared_toy, which takes a set of arguments and constructs a toy from the name or using a copy of another toy.
